    WHAT DOES THIS DO??
    -----------
    Generates a structured prompt for a language model to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning 
    based on provided document context.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    query : str
        The user query to be answered by the model.

    chunks : list of dict
        A list of context chunks from source documents. Each chunk should contain:
            - 'content': list of text segments (e.g., paragraphs)
            - 'filename' or 'metadata': optional source information

    Returns:
    -------
    prompt : str
        A formatted prompt containing:
            - Context extracted from the input chunks
            - Reasoning instructions for the model
            - Sample Q&A examples to guide the output style

    Details:
    --------
    - Each chunkâ€™s content is truncated to ensure compatibility with model token limits.
    - The prompt enforces step-by-step, transparent reasoning.
    - Useful in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines where factual grounding is necessary.

Before answering, follow these steps:
1. Understand the question and its assumptions.
2. Check if the context supports the question's premise (e.g., names, years, events).
3. If an assumption is incorrect or not found in the context, politely correct it.
4. If the answer isn't present, say so clearly.
5. If valid, break down the answer step by step, especially for time-based questions (year/month), and respond chronologically.

Example 3:
Context: Flipkart was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal.
Question: When did Jac find Flipkart?
Answer:
